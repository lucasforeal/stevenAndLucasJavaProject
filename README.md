# cps122-2021-p1

Starting code for Project 1 in CPS 122: Object Oriented Software Development.

Students should only modify these files:
* README.md (this file)

        Update the "Status" section below before the project is due

* ImageEditor/src/main/java/edu/gordon/cs/imageeditor/ProjectImage.java

        Write all your "new functionality" code here

* ImageEditor/src/main/java/edu/gordon/cs/imageeditor/ButtonPanel.java

        Uncomment code for UI buttons as you implement the underlying features.

* ImageEditor/src/test/java/edu/gordon/cs/imageeditor/ProjectImageTest.java

        Write additional unit tests here (extra credit)

Don't change anything else!

# Status

## Preliminary Milestone status
Before the Milestone is due, add answers to these questions:

* Which 3 features did you implement? (It's OK to list more than 3.)

        Darken, enhance and reduce contrast.

        P: Partly complete or partly working - with explanation
        Y: Yes, you think it is complete and correct

If you answer P, please also explain the status (what works, and what doesn't).
